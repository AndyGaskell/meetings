 0) State of the Membership
 - We currently have 22 members on our register
 - We have an average paying member count of 13 (last 3-month avg)
 - 7 members can be classified as both non-paying and absent, so are 
   therefore due for dismemberment 
 - The board acknowledges a number of house-keeping actions have fallen due 
   (such as dismemberment) and resolve to move on these tasks once a full board 
   has been chosen.

1) We moved to the Engage space
 - We shuttered for a month to help with timings and reduce rent.
 - We spent money on a first and second fit (£193 and £245 accordingly)

 - We have been granted use for as long we find it useful. 
 - It is a work in progress
