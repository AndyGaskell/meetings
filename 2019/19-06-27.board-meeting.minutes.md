# Dismemeberment

Discussion about dismemeberment, members who have left / are no-longer paying subs.

Need a process for dismemeberment. Possibly something sending an email notice.  Discussed members avoiding dismenberment by paying 2 months subs, rather than all outstanding.  

Side note from hibby: Paragraph 22 of the articles details our expulsion from membership requirements: 
    
    We must provide a written reminder and then after that remove them.  Ormiret has this automated afaik. 
    There is precedent for this in http://lists.57north.co/pipermail/57north-announce/2017-March/000262.html 
    The attachment of minutes is scrubbed but it has a dismemberment section that we can copy.
