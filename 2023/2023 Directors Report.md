Directors Report 2021-2023
----------------

## 0) State of the Membership
We have 19 members on the books, 7 dismemberment emails have been sent and this has resulted in some members coming back into the fold.
Incoming Directors shall need to have a board meeting to finalise dismemberment following AGM.  
We currently have 12 members paying regularly, resulting in a monthly income of Â£240.

## 1) 'Post pandemic' activities
Winter party 2022 was a roaring success. Thanks go to Q for making it so busy and inviting their friends who helped remind some of us why running a hackerspace is such good fun.

## 2) Books Tax & HMRC

## 3) Funding and Grants
Vishnee pulled together a funding application for Just Transition Participatory Budgeting, and we were dismayed to learn this amounted to a popularity contest and public vote. Thanks for your efforts, and the information gathered/text written will help us in future endeavours. 

## 4) Workshops & Outreach
Midder has been very active in recruiting new faces through the social center and alternative freshers fair, thank you for your efforts.
We'd like more regular faces to become members and to recruit new faces so there is a fresh flow of new people and income to keep us stable.
Any efforts on recruitment would be greatly appreciated. irl put in good work on updating the membership process and we generally agree this needs simplified and what you're signing up for has to be more clearly signposted.

## 5) Digital Infrastructure
Lots of things were rationalised and restarted this year.
garioch.57north.org.uk was retired, thank you for your service. 

Hibby moved the wiki from hackr->scotcon->ythan.57north.org.uk.

The website now resides on ythan. 

Mailing Lists were migrated to ythan, worked, didn't work, hibby had a meltdown, they worked again, now consistently.

Outstanding projects that need volunteers to look at:
  * Removing ID from hackhub
  * Modernising/updating hackhub to allow simple edits like adding admin-permissions checkbox and allowing users to change address
  * Migrating hub to a more modern server and allowing a print out of the list of registers
  * Making the website a static site with more relevant information
