Directors Report 2021-2023
----------------

## 0) State of the Membership
- We currently have 19 members on our register
- We have 12  memberspaying regularly, resulting in a monthly income of £240.
- 7 dismemberment emails have been sent and this has resulted in some members coming back into the fold.
- Incoming Directors shall need to have a board meeting to finalise dismemberment following AGM.  

## 1) 'Post pandemic' activities
- Open Tuesday's have returned post pandemic in 2021
- Winter party 2022 was a roaring success. Thanks go to Q for making it so busy and inviting their friends who helped remind some of us why running a hackerspace is such good fun.
- Monthly Consular Convention for Control & Prohibition of Pandemics were introduced in 2021.

## 2) Books Tax & HMRC
- We're still doing our own books, this saves us ~£500 in accounting fees, so is still good.  Thanks Andy and irl.
- We are now recognised as tax dormant to HMRC. This status will last either until April 2026 or until income deriving from non-member sources execeeds an annual corporation tax liability of £100, whichever occurs first.  This saves a lot of stress and paperwork.
- The only reporting obligation we have is with compabnies house.  Full details are provided by the Treasurers Report.

## 3) Costs and overheads
Discussions are ongoing with Aberdeen Action On Disability about bills.  Costs related to this will fall in the finacial year 2023-2024.  We will need to settle bills for the last aproximatly two years, in addition to ongoing costs.  These are higher than they were historicaly, due to the global increase in energy costs.  We face no other significant costs.

## 4) Funding and Grants
Vishnee pulled together a funding application for Just Transition Participatory Budgeting, and we were dismayed to learn this amounted to a popularity contest and public vote. Thanks for your efforts, and the information gathered/text written will help us in future endeavours. 

## 5) Workshops & Outreach
Midder has been very active in recruiting new faces through the social center and alternative freshers fair, thank you for your efforts.
We'd like more regular faces to become members and to recruit new faces so there is a fresh flow of new people and income to keep us stable.
Any efforts on recruitment would be greatly appreciated. irl put in good work on updating the membership process and we generally agree this needs simplified and what you're signing up for has to be more clearly signposted.  Hopefully workshops will be something we can do more of in the next 12 months. 

## 6) Digital Infrastructure
Lots of things were rationalised and restarted this year.
garioch.57north.org.uk was retired, thank you for your service. 

Hibby moved the wiki from hackr->scotcon->ythan.57north.org.uk.

The website now resides on ythan. 

Mailing Lists were migrated to ythan, worked, didn't work, hibby had a meltdown, they worked again, now consistently.

Outstanding projects that need volunteers to look at:
  * Removing ID from hackhub
  * Modernising/updating hackhub to allow simple edits like adding admin-permissions checkbox and allowing users to change address
  * Migrating hub to a more modern server and allowing a print out of the list of registers
  * Making the website a static site with more relevant information 

## 7) Equipment
A whole new collection of kit has arrived in the space. Thank you to all contributors. Here are few listed (and many other forgotten).
- Laser cutter
- Tables and chairs
- Canon A0 printer with scanner
- Disco light setup.
- and so much more

## 8) Remote or distant members
This is discussed at this AGM.

## 9) Events
Some members went to EMF Camp and had an awesome time (according to rumours).
