Treasurers Report
-----------------

## Overview

This treasurers report covers our last financial year, 1st March 2023 - 28th
February 2024, but also has detail until now for completeness.

We are still recognised as effectively tax dormant to HMRC. This status will
last either until April 2026 or until income deriving from non-member sources
exceed an annual corporation tax liability of £100, whichever occurs first.

We have the bank under control at the moment - currently hibby is the named
person, we understand how to change this (thanks irl!) and we have finally
managed to remove Ed from the account. Thanks for your years of service pal!
