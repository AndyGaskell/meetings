Directors Report 2021-2023
----------------

## 0) State of the Membership
- We currently have 16 members on our register
- We have 12 local members paying regularly, resulting in a monthly income of £240.
- 1 gentle reminder about the 12 month rule has been sent.
- We have 1 distant member currently and 3 applications awaiting approval emails
  to be sent.
- We'd like more regular faces to become members and to recruit new faces so there is a fresh flow of new people and income to keep us stable.
- Sending follow-up emails after Open Tuesday has been good in recent months.
- Any efforts on recruitment would be greatly appreciated. The membership process has been revised and is going well. 

## 1) 'Post Pandemic' Activities
- Open Tuesday's have returned post pandemic in 2021
- Winter party 2022 was a roaring success. Thanks go to Q for making it so busy and inviting their friends who helped remind some of us why running a hackerspace is such good fun.
- Monthly Consular Convention for Control & Prohibition of Pandemics were introduced in 2021.

## 2) Books, Tax & HMRC
- The full details are provided by the Treasurers Report.

## 3) Costs and Overheads
- We paid AAOD £2,500 for years prior last April and £800 in October
- We have not paid AAOD since October due to the slight friction of emailing to
  ask permission.
- We would like to offer them £200/month for our residence here. This keeps us
  in good favour with them, we are making enough money to afford this.
- Backdating it to November makes sense as that's when we last paid them money. 

## 4) Digital Infrastructure
- Mailing lists are stable, please send more email!
- The website has been updated with more relevant/helpful information.

- Outstanding projects that need volunteers to look at:
  * Removing ID from hackhub
  * Modernising/updating hackhub to allow simple edits like adding admin-permissions checkbox and allowing users to change address
  * Migrating hub to a more modern server and allowing a print out of the list of registers

## 5) Events
- Some members went to EMF Camp and had an awesome time (according to rumours).
- campGND 2023 was a success
- campGND 2024 is coming soon, get a free ticket!
