# Membership #

We currently have 20 members - two new people since the last AGM. 

There are currently 5 members on the books who've not paid for long enough that they've almost certainly left, we just haven't got round to processing actual dismemberment for them.

# Changes to the space # 

Ummm, there's some more shelves...

Doorbot died and has been replaced with a Pi. That code is now also on github:
