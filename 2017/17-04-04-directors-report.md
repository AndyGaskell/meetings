# Changes to the space #

We got a sofa, and moved most other things in the space to make room for it.

We built some more shelves under the standing bench. 

We've started running a tuck-shop.

The wiring for the lights has been made much less hideous. 

## ID ##

Shell implemented a new ID management system for the space so there is now the possibility of having one account to connect to multiple space services. 

Hackhub, wiki, matrix, git repos and GNU Social are already using this. If anybody has anything they'd like to hook up to this talk to Shell.
