# Membership #

We currently have 18 members.

20 memberships have been terminated and 3 people have joined (and are still with us) since the last AGM. 

# Changes to the space #

We got a sofa, and moved most other things in the space to make room for it.

We built some more shelves under the standing bench. 

We've started running a tuck-shop.

The wiring for the lights has been made much less hideous. 

## ID ##

Shell implemented a new ID management system for the space so there is now the possibility of having one account to connect to multiple space services. 

Hackhub, wiki, matrix, git repos and GNU Social are already using this. If anybody has anything they'd like to hook up to this talk to Shell.

# Places we went #

Hibby's report as self appointed trip secretary:

## Edinburgh Mini Maker Faire ##

This was our first year at the MMF and, on the whole, it was a success. WSPR raised a bit of money and the rest of us talked too much.

Edinburgh Mini Maker Faire is happening on 2017-04-16. 

### Attendees ###

  * Nordin
  * Hibby
  * WSPR
  * [tj]
  * orimret
  
### Projects ###

  * Amateur Radio
  * 3d Printing
  * Pi PDP-11
  * Multiscreen display
  * Knot-tying wristbands

## campGND ##

campGND was a success. Radio Contacts were made, fun was had, fires were built. 

The new & improved network was a success, once [tj] had it stabilised. Congratulations to him. 

campGND returns in 2017, June 2-4.

## ElectroMagnetic Field 2016 (EMFCamp) ##

The EMF Excursion this year was better planned and attended than 2014, with new friends joining us to waste time under canvas!

### Attendees ###

  * Hibby
  * Doc0cassi
  * Gor_Zilla
  * Jim GM0UIN
  * oholiab
  * ormiret
  * WSPR

### Tent ###

The tent worked very well this year - we had our accommodation module, 'Saddams Palace', the main white consular office and the blue gazebo acting as a vestibule, 'Assad's Gazebo'. 

It was universally agreed we should continue to name our tents after despots - suggestions for future expansion include something attributed to "Gadaffi", a chemical toilet named "Chemical Ali's Throne" and maybe we'll have an "SNP Collaboration Office" in future too.

Additions to the tent included:
  * Rob's Air Con system: a fan blowing through some metal ducting. This was excellent
  * Rob's RGB LED Lights:  these made being in the tent at night better lit and were great
  * Assad's Gazebo: a front room providing shade for a relaxation area - bean bags and sunloungers. Lots of interesting discussions were had in here.

We might want to move away from having Nordin's tent, "Saddam's Palace" - we're maybe causing unnecessary wear and tear to it. To be discussed with Nordin.

### Whiteboard ###

The whiteboard was popular this year - Doc0cassi wrote different statements on it each day, and we could talk to people who'd stopped to ponder what was being claimed!

The whiteboard system will have to be refined and taken to Congress/future events.

### Asylum ###

The asylum program went **so** well this year.

People from all over came by to get their certificate of True Scotsmanship. It proved a great introduction and talking point, and people responded well to it.

### Evening Social Events ###

These were, overall good! Let's be more organised next time maybe

### Night 1 - Whisky Leaks. ###

As ever, Whiskyleaks went well. Carnage ensued, our scottish accents were appreciated.

### Night 2 - Go Dutch (Buckfast) ###

The Dutch didn't appreciate us turning up in their camp with Buckfast too much.

We ended up going to Milliways and being awake until daytime. Whoops.

### Night 3 - Breakdown Chill ###

This was super chill. Cool people came over and we talked politics, hacking, tech and life until the party was shut down by the neighbours at 4am.

### BBS ###

Meeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

This needs work. Hibby needs to think about this concept some more.

### Talks ###

WSPR gave a great talk on the reverse engineering of dangerous goods. He wins the prize for being the first of us to give a proper, organised talk. Well done.

EMF returns in 2018. This year's summer trip is to the Netherlands - SHA2017 - https://sha2017.org/.

## 33rd Chaos Communication Congress ##

Our annual German winter trip was a successful blur, as was expected.

[tj] gave lightning talks that were very successful.
hibby ran 3 sesssions that were very successful.

Everyone partied, which was very successful.

We participated heavily in the milliways schedule of evening events, the highlight, as ever, being Whiskyleaks. 
Once again, the Scottish presence was appreciated.

34C3 is yet to be formally announced for 2017, but given there is an organising committee, it will probably happen.
An estimate would put the dates as being the 27th December - 30th December.
