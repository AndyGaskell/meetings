Board of directors meeting 17/03/16 (most significant digits first in that date. AS THEY SHOULD BE)

# Dismemberment

We have a list of members to go through and terminate, or not, as applicable.

# AGM

Is supposed to be organised in April. Can we pick a date now?

## Financial report

We need one for the AGM.

## Activity report

We need one of these as well.

# Creative funding

[creative funding](http://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/community_life_leisure/arts/culture/CreativeFunding.asp)

Can we maybe get something out of this?
