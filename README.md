Meetings
========

Each year of meetings will be in a folder, for this year 2013. Each
meeting is made of two files, prefixed with the meeting date. 

	- Agenda, eg 2013-10-22-Agenda.md
	- Minutes, eg 2013-10-22-Minutes.md

An agenda file that will contain the meeting agenda, pull requests/patches 
should be
allowed up to the meeting date. After that we should have some sort of 
casual locking to it.

The second file contains the minutes of what actually happened at the
meeting. Post meeting date(once it has been pushed) the only changes should
be spelling.

These files should be written up as markdown, because it is the best format
for mildly structured text.
