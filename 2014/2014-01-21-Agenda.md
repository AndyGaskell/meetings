## Finances

How much money have we got?

### Membership count

A count of how many people have paid each month is now available at http://hackerdeen.org/api/membership

There is a lousy graph of that at
http://hackerdeen.org/api/membership/graph and the bot in the IRC
channel will give a text version in response to ?histogram.

Anyone who wants to improve the graph (or anything else on the
website) should talk to Robert.

## Passwords

Do we have a full list yet?

## Furniture

We have more shelves now - hopefully they won't fall down.

There might be another standing desk too...

## Members boxes

We should have some more available.

## Party

It happened.

Did we break even? Make a profit?

## Blinkenlights

There were/are some flashing lights in the ceiling, but less than were
originally planned so there is scope for more work on this.

## Legal stuff / organising an actual organisation

We are now at the time we agreed to revisit this.

We held a meeting on the 15th and have put a plan together. There are 
still a few unknowns in the plan though. 

The outline is to form a Company Limited by Guarentee with an initial 
board of five members. Currently we have three volunteers and a few 
maybes. In the worst case we will form with a board of the three members
that have put themselves forward.

Need to confirm date for this and get an idea of who's doing it (or at
least make sure that someone is...).

## Intro workshop

What's happening with this?

## Work Shops

We are planning to run workshops at three events in the future and could 
really do with volunteers to help out.

 - A schools Event being run by Iain
 - Engineering Science Week, being run by Tom, Iain and Ed running in March
 - Hack n Make, happening in May still TBC
 
At the Hack n Make event there is scope to run multiple workshops. Maybe the 
MakeIt-Glo workshop and a lockpicking event.

## Rebranding

At the company planning meeting it was decided to not register the business with
the name Hackerdeen. When organising the Engineering Science Week event we also
decided a different name was needed. As we needed a logo and Hackerdeen didn't 
really bring any ideas we looked for a different name. 

For the Company and Workshops the plan is to use the name **57 North Hacklab**
with the common abbreiviation of **57 North**. We have logos, a poster, domains
irc, twitter all setup. 

Should we move to this name for the space entirely and subsume the name Hackerdeen?


## Donations

The space is able to take donations and any none members using the space should be
encouraged to give a little. This will help us build funds beyond just membership.

We also have a jar for beer money, please donate before taking drink.

## Things **YOU** can do for the space

 - Pay membership on time (we are working on standing orders)
 - Help with planned workshops
 - Plan events in the space
 - Run group projects
 - Donate Hardware
 - Bring in new members
  
 Can anyone think of more?

## Stock of components

We've talked about getting a stock of components for the space. 

Can we put together a list of what we want for that and then get in some stock. 

What do we want to do for paying for things? Take it out of general
funds? Put a jar somewhere and when using things you should drop some
money in it?

## Intro email for new members

We agreed at last meeting that we'd like to have something going out to new members. 

Robert has put together something at

Please read and give feedback/ pull requests.
