# Make It Glo workshop

action report here.

# Hack'n'Make

Happening on Sunday 11th May. 

We will have space to show off projects and/or run workshop(s). 

There are plans afoot to run a workshop making a badge from our logo. 

Tom is coordinating. 

# Break in

The space was broken into. More details at http://adventurist.me/posts/0016 

We are looking at making it harder for this to happen again, and
adding some recording from cameras covering at least the door to give
a record if it does.

There are now keys for the front door in the space (on a hook by the
door attached to some old RAM) - if you're the last person out please
take one and lock the door when you leave, then take the key back next
time you're in.

# Joining Make Aberdeen 

We could get a small business membership of Make Aberdeen to give all
members of 57N access to the Make machines at member.

# AOCB

Anything else?

# Next meeting

When?
