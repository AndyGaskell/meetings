## Meeting opens

## Chair

Carl is elected chair.

## Removal of unpaid members

This is to be dealt with by the board.

## Additional membership rate

This is being floated as there may be potential members not joining because they can't afford the current rate. 

At least 4 people are reported to have asked for a reduced rate.

Points against:

- Hassle of managing it.
- Determination of who qualifies is awkward.
- Differing rates could upset people who are being forced to pay more.
- Equal opportunities stuff could cause legal problems.

Tom alternatively proposes setting up a membership sponsorship fund to collect donations and pay for memberships for some people. 

This fund could be run outside of 57N. 

Neil notes Leeds offer tiered membership with different access. 

CONCLUSION: There will be no change to membership rate. Anyone who
wants to set up and run a sponsorship fund is welcome to - we would
like to hear how that goes. A question is to be added to the
questionaire to investigate this issue.

## Changes to the articles


### Proposal to reduce to 3 directors. 

This proposal is defeated 7 votes to 0.

### Rename articles to space corp directives

Iain proposes that this is voted on on the mailing list. This proposal is defeated 6 votes to 0. 

Iain notes that "on on" could be transformed to "noo noo" and would then be the name of the hoover in tellytubbies. 

Tom proposes that the change is moved into the definitions section of the articles. This proposal is carried 7 votes to 1.

### Change of number of signatories to 1

The desire to do this is to allow the use of online banking that is not currently possible. 

Carl raised issues with a small number of people being able to spend money as they could decide to spend money on things that the wider group wouldn't approve of. 

Robert proposes an alternative that all spending is proposed to the committee list and spending be approved by at least 2 directors (via signed email to the committee list) and can be prohibited if a majority of directors oppose it. The articles can be amended to allow one signatory for the actual operation, allowing the use of online banking subject to the above approval. 

This proposal is carried 8 votes to 0.

## Election of directors

Tom proposes: give 2 weeks for people to stand by sending an email to 57n-announce stating that they want to stand. We will then run an election on opavote open for all members to vote for 1 week finishing on the 5th October. 

This proposal is unanimously approved.

## AOCB


### Accounts

We have £968.81 in the bank. There is still £133.08 potentially outstanding for electricity. 

Our costs have been averaging around £340/month.

We have averaged a deficit of around £120/month recently. 

This gives us around 8 months till we run out of money.
