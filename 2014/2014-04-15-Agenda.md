#Agenda 2014-04-22

##Pictures of cats
Iain will present his pictures of cats.

##Directors Report
Bank account (we should have one by now)
Thanks to Calum for providing fire extinguisher.

##Dangerous equipment in the space

Ed needs to document the tools bench on the wiki.

##Business cards

Business cards will not be produced by the space.

Members are welcome to create their own cards showing their 57North email addresses.

##Space Network

Rack has been built and populated.

Iain and Carl have admin access to the routers/switches.

All stations have at least 1 ethernet connection.

##Previous actions:

> Rowan + Iain: email accounts for social media.

Email accounts exist, broke all email for a while.

> Flickr group/media storage

We have a Flickr group now https://www.flickr.com/groups/57n

If you want to be a member tell Robert your Flickr username and you'll get an invite. 

> Rowan + Iain: Calendar access - has this been sorted?

OpenTechCalendar is broken: it offers no feature to change ownership
of an account/group/thing. Someone needs to talk to the folks running
it to see if this can be done manually.

> Ed + Rowan: New member procedure?

This is important.

> Unknown: Create general email going out with latest minutes to all users.

Iain notes that this is difficult to write a script for if people cannot spell agenda.

> Poster

Iain made one. Still outstanding to get the source distributed for
others to make changes/derivatives?

##Hack and Make
11th May
Have other groups (Edinburgh/Be-cycle) been invited.
People should confirm they are willing to help with workshops etc.
Who has a project they would like to show off in our booth?

##Security
Tony: Progress on:
London bars
Replace locks
CCD cameras
Safe lock

##Power
We pay for power.
Carl will document a closing procedure to power off all non-essential items.
This should be placed by the door and is the responsibility of the last person out to make sure it is followed.

##Photos/media
We need pics for social media of us being super rad and stuff.
Do we have enough?

##Themed Thursdays

We should have just had an excellent night playing Red Alert 2.
Unless more Themed Thursdays are volunteered, there will be no more Themed Thursdays.

There was talk of repeating lock picking and/or board games (possibly
just as a cards against humanity night?).

The website listing for this was out of date for a while (and probably
will be again soon). Updating it is currently a manual process that
must be done by someone with access to the webserver. It should happen
more often now that more people are on that list. Would be good to
make it update automatically from something that more people can be
given right access to than we trust to have root access to the
server. Anyone able and willing to write that should talk to Iain,
Robert or Tom (or possibly other people if we get round to giving
anyone else access). In the meantime: prod someone on that list to
update it if you notice it's out of date.

##Replacing hub
Hub does not need to be replaced.

Feature requests should go to the wiki, mailing list or directly to
Robert.

There are plans afoot to add support for tweeting from hub but there
is no timeline for when it will be done (so much other stuff to do...).

Any help with improvements would be appreciated.  

##Cooperation with Satrosphere
Has any ation been taken on this?
Is this going to have to wait until after the Hack and Make?

## Membership cards

We have been kicking around some ideas for making membership cards
that could be used as doorbot keys. 

Nothing definite has come of this yet as there are outstanding
questions on the dual purpose of showing membership to other people
and containing some secret that can authenticate to doorbot.

If anyone has any ideas please speak up.

## member emails

All members now have <username>@m.57north.co directing mail to the
email address they have registered in hackhub.

## Future meetings

Do we need to have a serious business meeting every month?

It is useful to have regular state-of-the-space updates but do we need
to be having an actual meeting to go through this? meetings burn quite
lot of person time, limit the peopl who can participate in discussions
to those who can be present at the time of the meeting, force any
discussion on an issue to include everyone rather than just those who
care about it, and because of that include pressure to not discuss
things too much.

PROPOSAL: Do away with the actual meeting part of our meetings.
Instead collate a state-of-the-space update from what would currently
be the agenda to go out to -announce on the current meeting
schedule. Discussion about any of the issues can happen on -discuss or
with single topic face to face meetings as desired by the people
interested in that topic.

##AOCB

##Next Meeting

If the abandoning meetings proposal is passed the next meeting will be
the AGM, else it will be some other time.
