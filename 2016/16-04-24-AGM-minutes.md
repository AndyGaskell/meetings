# Report on activities since last AGM
## Membership
We currently have 31 members. This is up 6 from the last AGM. We haven't
had any members officially leave over the last year but there are some
where we haven't seen them (or their money) for a while. Tidying that up
will be on the TODO list for the new board.

Over the last 6 months (15/10 to 16/3) we averaged 15 and a third
members paying each month.
## Changes to the space
We haven't actually changed much over the last year - either we've got
the space to a point where it's working or everyone has just given up. 

We have gotten some new tools and have gotten rid of some of the junk
that's been cluttering up the space for ages. 

We raised pledges to purchase a 3D printer kit in September 2015. That
printer has now been assembled, and modified a bit, and is available for
use.

There are plans in the works to redesign things a bit to make the
space more usable. 

## New space?
We have investigated a couple of possibilities for places to move the
space to. As yet we haven't found anything we can afford that would be
an improvement on the current space. 

The search is ongoing; if anyone has any leads please do let us know.
## Places we went
Some of our members have been out and about flying the 57N flag at
events.
### CCCamp
### CCCongress
### Edinburgh Mini Maker Faire

Calum rasied some money from his paracord bracelet workshop.

### Upcoming

Some folks will be at EMF. 
## Meetings 
Our last AGM was on the 16th of April 2015. 

Since then we have had one director's meeting, on the 11th of November
2015. This meeting was to approve our accounts for the period up to
28th February 2015 so they could be submitted to the appropriate
authorities.

# Modification of articles to allow remote participation in meetings. 

There is a proposal to modify our articles of association to allow
remote participation in meetings. 

This will involve the addition of two clauses, and the modification of
two existing clauses. 

The first insertion will be in the section "Procedure at AGMs and EGMs"
after clause 46 and will read "A member shall be considered to be
present at a general meeting if they can communicate with all others
present."

The first modification will be of clause 81 in the section "Procedure at
board meetings". This clause currently reads "No valid decisions can be
taken at a board meeting unless a quorum is present; the quorum for
board meetings is 3 directors, present in person." The words "present in
person" will be removed to give "No valid decisions can be taken at a
board meeting unless a quorum is present; the quorum for board meetings
is 3 directors."

The second modification will be of clause 84 in the section "Procedure
at board meetings". This clause currently reads "Each director has one
vote, which must be given in person." and will be changed to read "Each
director has one vote, which must be given by them being present."

The second insertion will also be in the section "Procedure at board
meetings", this new clause will be inserted at the end of the section,
after the current clause 89, and will read "A director shall be
considered to be present at a board meeting if they can communicate with
all others present."

Articles modified to reflect these changes are available at
https://github.com/ormiret/articles, with the diff at
https://github.com/ormiret/articles/commit/79fc96dbff637d65290693cf0c986fce599f6cfa

This is unanimously approved. 

# Election of directors

Carl Anderson does not want to stand for reelection. 

Kevin Mulhern does want to stand. 

The remaining existing directors are willing to stand again. 

There were no other nominations - so the board will now be:
 - Tom Jones
 - Ed Watson
 - Dave Hibberd
 - Kevin Mulhern
 - Robert McWilliam

# Any Other Competent Business

There was no other competent business.
