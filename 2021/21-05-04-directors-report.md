Directors' Report 04/05/21
----------------



## 0) State of the Membership
* We currently have 16 members on our register
* We have 7 members who have paid for all of the last 3 months
* 4 members can be classified as both non-paying and absent, so are therefore due for dismemberment
* The board acknowledges a number of house-keeping actions have fallen due (such as dismemberment) and resolve to move on these tasks once a full board has been chosen.
 

## 1) There is a pandemic, in which we're operating
* Obviously
* This has limited face to face interactions and many other activities
* We've not had an Open Tuesday since March 2020
* Discussion is required, but inline with government guidelines we may be able to re-commence Open Tuesdays
* Hopefully we can have some sort of small event when restrictions / weather / time depending


## 2) Operating online
We have been doing more online activities. We've recently moved from Mumble to WorkAdventure for Tuesday hangouts, this has been working well.

Remote activities
* WorkAdventure
* IRC
* Mumble
* Hack & tell


## 3) Books, Tax and HMRC
* We're still doing our own books, this saves us ~£500 in accounting fees, so is still good.
* We are now recognised and tax exempt for the next 5 years (till April 2026). HMRC repaid the £200 in fines that we'd previously paid them.


## 4) Space at kettock lodge
We now have a fairly huge amount of space, perhaps ~200m2 which is about the size of a typical 4 bed house in Aberdeen. It's been effectively zoned into areas for different functions, such as deskwork, relaxation and toolwork. Some recent photos of the space can be seen at https://photos.app.goo.gl/QymN8EkGd8xDdvVM7


## 5) Possibility of moving to charitable status
We have previously discussed the advantages and disadvantages of moving to being a charity.  This is still on the table, as an idea, but we've not moved forward with it really. The status is pretty much the same as last year.

## 6) Funding and grants
In 2019 we looked at some funding options, both locally and nationally. The status is pretty much the same as last year.

## 7) Workshops and programs
We've not done much in regard to this, due to lockdowns. Hopefully this will be something we can do more of in the next 12 months. There is potential for more collaborations with the Aberdeen Science Center, in it's new expanded location.  We'll try to look at other potential collaborations.


## 8) Publications
We've not done anything re this, far as I know.


## 9) Remote or distant members
This was discussed at the previous AGM. We've not made any progress of formalising this really. I think all agreed it is generally a good idea, in some form or other. The status is pretty much the same as last year.


## 10) CampGND
* CampGND is an online event again this year, on the 28-30th May 2021
* The CampGND site https://campgnd.com/
* CampGND on Twitter https://twitter.com/campgnd
* CampGND talks as videos from last year https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC461YdqBMfjBa_1W5izjrRQ
* CampGND is loosly afiliated with the hackspace
