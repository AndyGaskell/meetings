# Treasurer's Report


## Overview

This treasurers report covers our last financial year, 1st March 2024 - 28th February 2025, but also has detail until now for completeness.

We are still recognised as effectively tax dormant to HMRC. This status will last either until April 2026 or until income deriving from non-member sources exceed an annual corporation tax liability of £100, whichever occurs first. The incoming directors will need to revalidate this.

We *still* have the bank under control! Currently hibby and Andy are named and on freeagent and we have much better visibility of our finances.
