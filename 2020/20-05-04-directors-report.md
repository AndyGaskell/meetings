Directors' Report required for 2019-2020 #14 




## 0) State of the Membership
* We currently have TBC members on our register
* We have an average paying member count of TBC (last 3-month avg)
* TBC members can be classified as both non-paying and absent, so are therefore due for dismemberment 
* The board acknowledges a number of house-keeping actions have fallen due (such as dismemberment) and resolve to move on these tasks once a full board has been chosen.
 
 
 
## 1) We moved to the Kettock Lodge
* We had to move from the Engage Space
* We moved from the Engage Space to Kettock Lodge
* We looked at a variety of possible locations, see https://wiki.57north.org.uk/doku.php?id=possible_future_space 
* Partitioning of the space is still ongoing https://wiki.57north.org.uk/doku.php?id=projects:partitioning_furniture



## 2) The current situation in Kettock Lodge
* We now have more space TBC m2, up from ~TBC m2
* We are currently paying £TBC per quarter in rent
* We are currently paying £TBC per quarter in bills
 
 
 
## 3) We have been doing our own books
For over a year now we have been doing our own Accounting.  In practice, previously we were doing the book-keeping ourselves and an accounting was doing the HMRC submissions for us.  This has been positive in that we save quite a lot of money, I think ~£900 p/a.  It has been negative in that it has caused stress and aniety to those involved.  We had one submission that failed due to an issue with HRMC registration credentials, which caused us to be fined for late submission, this is described in more detail in the next point. 
 
 
 
## 4) Tax/HMRC Discussions
We initially submitted a joint companies house and corporation tax via the online system at gov.uk in October 2018.  At the time the joint submission seemed to complete and process successfully.  Several months later we realised that only the companies house portion of the submission had been processed.  It seems that the Gov ID we were using was not activated for HMRC submissions, only companies house, though there was no indication that this was the case at the time.  After phoning HMRC and discussing it, we attempted to submit online again.  To register the Gov ID for use with HMRC we attempted to register the account with HMRC, via a posted out code.  Unfortunately at the time we were having trouble receiving mail in a timely way, due to the all mail going via our host premises at Engage.  Despite several online requests for posted out codes, we were unable to receive and use them before they expired.  We then moved to a Kettock Lodge, where we no longer had issues receiving post.  We have subsequently submitted our CT600 and related documents to complete the FY2017/18 submission.  We received two fines of £100 each for late submission.  We appealed the fines, that total £200, as suggested by the HMRC helpline.  The appeal preocess is due to be complete, we are just waiting receive notification of it's result.

 
  
## 5) Wiki Move

Mailing list discussions...
In April the wiki was moved from an old server using MediaWiki, to a new server, using DocuWiki.  The change of server was due to the old server being EOL. The change of wiki system was to simplify the hosting, operation and maintenance of the wiki.  The move is still a work in progress, to a degree, as we are yet to get the imported images in place.

## 7) Possibility of moving to charitable status
We have previously discussed the advantages and disadvantages of moving to being a charity.  This is still on the table, as an idea, but we've not moved forward with it really.
