0) State of the Membership
* We currently have TBC members on our register
* We have an average paying member count of TBC (last 3-month avg)
* TBC members can be classified as both non-paying and absent, so are therefore due for dismemberment 
* The board acknowledges a number of house-keeping actions have fallen due (such as dismemberment) and resolve to move on these tasks once a full board has been chosen.
 
 
1) We moved to the Kettock Lodge
