# Items discussed

## 0) Review of previous AGM minutes
The previous AGM’s minutes were briefly reviewed.  No issues or points were raised.

## 1) State of Membership (DR item 0)
* Reviewed membership numbers from directors report
* Tom raised that members who usually pay cash have had no way to pay, so look like non-paying members, but kind of are not
* Removal / dismemberment process was discussed 

## 2) Kettock lodge (DR items 1 & 2)
* Discussed the move and reasons for the move.
* Discussed settling in process and are now enlarged space
* Discussed the loose agreement with the contact at AAD
* Just paying bills, £200 per quarter
* Agreed it is a positive situation with many benefits

## 3) Bookkeeping, Accounts and HMRC  (DR items 3 & 4)
* Andy described current bookkeeping and accounts process.
* Positives of doing our own HMRC submission, saving money.  Negatives of stress and learning curve.
* Described the issues with one problematic submission.

## 4) Wiki move (DR item 5)
* Hibby described the wiki move, motivations, issues and progress. 
* Rob asked about user account creation, Hibby mentioned spam issues but suggested opening account creation for a period.

## 5) Hackspace in a pandemic (DR item 6)
* Mumble meetings on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday, just ad-hoc organised via mailing list. Feedback on mumble was positive.
* Agreed to try and think of positive ways for the hackspace to exist in the current situation

## 6) Charity Status and Funding (DR items 7 & 8)
* Charitable status was discussed before, most recently at directors meeting last summer, it was put on the back burner because of the issues with Engage Space and the need to move.
* We decided it would be a good time to revisit it, now we have a bite more time.
* Agreed to contact ACVO and see if they’re still operating.
* Funding has not been looked into much in the last 12 months
* We agreed to revisit it, looking again at the documents written before.
*  Our new more secure financial situation may be better for funding where fund matching is an option.

## 7) Workshops (DR item 9)
* Ed commented it was not a strong weapon for recruitment
* Some events like TechFest did not seem to be a good proposition
* Events good for general public awareness of the HackSpace
* Events with ASC were positive, may be some good opportunities when ASC moves back into it’s permanent home.

## 8) Equipment (DR item 10)
* Lulzbot issues with software going forward.  Need to investigate is debian stable is ok, if an Ubuntu LTS would work, or if something like Octoprint is an options.  Lulzbot’s version of Cura is not a long term option really, now the company has gone bust.
* Agreed it was worth documenting that the Lulzbot was purchased by an ad-hoc group of members and donated to the space.
* Some discussion of if it was a capital asset.  Agreed that we might need to identify what value made something a capital asset.  Rob mentioned if this was relative to funds, then the number would go up and down, and would now be higher.

## 9) Events (DR item 11)
* CampGND was great
* The amature radio events (2 in the last 12 months) were good and raised awareness of the hackspace
* NortherRST was fun and brought people to the space
* EMF Camp cancelled, so next one is 2022
* EMF Holland - next year (TBC, need to check, minuter’s notes unclear)
* Bonn Camp - next year (TBC, need to check, minuter’s notes unclear)

## 10) Publications
* Tom’s Hackspace magazine article was positive for the space
* The magazine is always looking for content and got in touch

## 11) Some other for of membership (DR item 13)
* Still viewed as something that would be good to do
* Iain said it would be handy for radio stuff
* Ed asked if we’d need to change any legal documents
* Rob said yes, if they’re members
* Tom said, let’s call them something else, supporters, fans, donors
* All agreed that, as an initiative, it just need someone to take it forward

## 12) Treasurer’s report

Ed presented the Treasurer’s report, the summary was...

> Based over the last 6 months of the accounting period these books represent (19/20), our average expenditure decreased to an average £185/mnth and our average income remained approx £380/mnth, leading to an average monthly surplus of £195 over that latter period. 
>
> As of the start of this 20/21 accounting period. we have grown a monthly average surplus of approx £320 but this is expected to fall in line with a current trend in smaller numbers of paying members. As of Monday 4th May 2020, the bank account stands at £2755.88. Our next total bill for rent/services costs will be £200, due end-June. 
> 
> In summary, since moving and reducing our rental bill we have been moved into a relatively healthy rolling surplus for the time being. 

...from https://github.com/hackerdeen/meetings/blob/master/2020/Treasurers%20Report%20-%20YE%2028th%20February%202020.pdf

It was generally viewed as being a positive financial situation.

## 12) Discussions on what to do re current pandemic situation
* Do we need to change the normal process for payment
* Discussion on the current process if a member has missed a months or more of membership.  The process is not wholly documented as-is.  Agreed to discuss this further at the next directors meeting.
* Agreed that a sympathetic email should be drafted making members aware that if they were struggling as a result of the pandemic they should not worry too much about missing membership payments.
* Ed raised the idea of adding focus to being a tool library.  As we can’t function as a place of social assemble at the moment, being more of a tool library would be of benefit to members.
* Discussion on what could be done to be a more effective tool library, like documenting tools and equipment, owned by the space and members. 

## 13) Mandatory Bikeshedding (not in order of occurrence)
* Not much bikeshedding occured really
* 60,000 trig points in the UK was a fun fact
* Some discussion of Jitsi as a platform, latency, warm devices and blurred backgrounds
* Peter’s clock widget overlay thing was agreed by all to be kind of nice
